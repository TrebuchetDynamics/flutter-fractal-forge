# settings

## Purpose
Accessibility settings screen for configuring visual and interaction preferences.

## Key Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `accessibility_settings_screen.dart` | `AccessibilitySettingsScreen` - toggles for high contrast, reduced motion, large text, and other accessibility options |

## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory
- Settings modify `AccessibilityService` (ChangeNotifier)
- High contrast toggle switches between `AppTheme.dark` and `AppTheme.highContrast`
- Changes persist via SharedPreferences through AccessibilityService

## Dependencies

### Internal
- `core/services/accessibility_service.dart` - Settings state
- `core/theme/app_theme.dart` - Theme variants

## Karpathy-Inspired Agent Guardrails

Source: https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills at commit `2c60614`.

These guardrails supplement the local instructions above. Local project, safety, and user-specific rules win on conflict.

Tradeoff: they bias toward caution over speed for non-trivial work; use judgment for obvious one-line fixes.

### Think Before Coding

- State assumptions before implementing; ask when uncertainty would change the solution.
- Surface multiple interpretations and tradeoffs instead of silently picking one.
- Push back when a simpler approach meets the goal.

### Simplicity First

- Build the minimum code that solves the requested problem.
- Avoid speculative features, single-use abstractions, and unnecessary configurability.
- If the solution is growing large, stop and simplify before continuing.

### Surgical Changes

- Touch only files and lines required by the request.
- Preserve existing style, comments, and nearby code unless the task requires changing them.
- Clean up only dead code introduced by your own change; mention unrelated dead code instead of deleting it.

### Goal-Driven Execution

- Convert the request into verifiable success criteria before editing.
- For multi-step work, state a short plan with a verification check for each step.
- Loop until the relevant tests, builds, or manual checks prove the goal is met.

## Project-Specific Karpathy Adjustment

This section localizes the Karpathy guardrails for `workspace-sidon/trebuchet-dynamics/flutter-fractal-forge/lib/features/settings`. Source inspiration: https://github.com/forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills at commit `2c60614`.

- Project family: Sidon fractal/rendering and visual-app workspace.
- Local focus: GPU/fractal rendering, Flutter/Electron apps, shaders, accessibility, and measurable visual behavior.
- Stack cues: Flutter/Dart.
- Evidence to prefer: test output, analyzer/linter output, screenshot/pixel checks when relevant, shader compile logs, frame/performance metrics, and exact UI state text.
- Surgical boundary: do not rely on visual vibes; validate rendering numerically and describe results in screen-reader-friendly text.
- Stop and ask when: a visual requirement lacks measurable acceptance criteria or accessibility impact is uncertain.
